# Operating System Scheduling algorithms 
# First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
# This code is for non-preemptive

**These algorithms are either non-preemptive or preemptive. Non-preemptive algorithms are designed so that once a process enters the running state, it cannot be preempted until it completes its allotted time, whereas the preemptive scheduling is based on priority where a scheduler may preempt a low priority running process anytime when a high priority process enters into a ready state.**


First Come First Serve (FCFS)


Jobs are executed on first come, first serve basis.


It is a non-preemptive, pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.


Easy to understand and implement.


Its implementation is based on FIFO queue.


Poor in performance as average wait time is high.
